# Reinforcement learning-based Navigation for Autonoumous Robot (based on PPO)
The algorithm is simulated in Gazebo based on a robot called scout.  
1. [Object detection by ladar](./vlp_fir/)
2. [Physical model of scout](./scout/description/)  
3. [World of simulation](./scout/gazebo/worlds/)  
4. [PPO algorithm](./scout/src)
